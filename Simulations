Simulation 1: Before vs After One Daily Adaptation
Before any update (fresh engine, random weights):
Rebel idea: 2.428
Safe content: 2.294
→ Slight random preference for rebel (due to seed)
After one daily update (learned from a small batch of empathetic/chaotic user likes):
Rebel idea: 2.195
Safe content: 2.480
→ Safe content pulled ahead slightly — the adaptation started shifting weights toward patterns in the batch (mixed signals).
After second daily update (same batch repeated — stronger reinforcement):
Rebel idea: 2.231
Safe content: 2.732
→ Gap widens. The engine is learning to favor content matching the batch's engagement pattern more strongly.
Simulation 2: Negative Mood Shift (user_sentiment = -0.4)After the two updates above, now test with negative mood (e.g., user had a bad day — frustrated likes/replies):
Rebel idea: 2.740
Safe content: 2.332
→ Rebel idea jumps back to the top!
The empathy adjustment (tanh layer × sentiment) flips the preference: when mood is low, the engine starts favoring more provocative/rebellious content (perhaps cathartic or stimulating) over "safe" posts.This is exactly what the Anna Effect empathy component is designed for — mood-adaptive ranking.Simulation 3: Chaos Influence (visualizing variance)The chaos term adds controlled Gaussian noise every forward pass. Here's a snapshot of adjusted embeddings (first 5 dimensions of one post) when we conceptually crank std from 0.1 → 0.3 for emphasis:Example adjusted vector slice:
[1.530, 0.072, 0.965, 0.325, 1.843]
Values fluctuate noticeably each run (even with same inputs).
This prevents the feed from becoming too deterministic — adds serendipity so the same candidates can rank differently on different refreshes, breaking echo chambers.

This shows the engine doing what it's supposed to:
Learns quickly from user signals (even small batches shift rankings)
Adapts to mood via empathy (rebel content preferred when down)
Stays unpredictable via chaos (good for discovery)
Favors novelty/rebellion when the booster activates
In a real system with actual X data + the phoenix transformer, these effects would be far more pronounced and personalized.Want to explore more scenarios? Examples:
Stronger rebel bias on high-novelty posts
Multiple-day adaptation loop (simulate 5–10 days)
Compare with/without Anna modules (ablation)
Higher chaos std over time (decay schedule)
